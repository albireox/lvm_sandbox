# Self calibration tests

This directory contains scripts to test the self-calibration of LVM science frames using Gaia sources.

These tests were prompted by the failure to acquire standard stars between March 19 and June 7, 2024 due to an issue with the fibre selector mask. Here I'm testing how well we can calibrate the science frame using only Gaia stars with XP spectra that are present in the FoV of the science IFU.
